      tips: 'Pitch yourself: Who are you? What do you offer? What do you want?\n\nTips for effective pitch:\n- Uncomplicated: It should be catchy and roll off the tongue\n- Concise: It shouldn’t take more than a minute to say or read\n- Unique: It reflects your skills, goals, and desires\n- Storyline: It covers who you are, what you offer, and where you want to be\n- Appealing: Your elevator pitch is essentially a persuasive sales pitch; the emphasis should be on what you offer'
