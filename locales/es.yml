      - **Connects You with Others:** Enables better matching with dance partners, instructors, and events.
      - **Personalizes Your Profile:** Provides a clear and detailed picture of your dance background and preferences.

      **Select Level:** After selecting your styles, you can specify your proficiency level:
      - **Beginner:** You are just starting to learn the dance style.
      - **Intermediate:** You have a good understanding and can perform with some confidence.
      - **Advanced:** You are highly skilled and can dance complex routines with ease.
      - **Professional:** You have expert-level proficiency, often teaching or performing professionally.

      Choose the level that accurately reflects your experience and skills for each dance style.

      question: How can I find my Facebook Calendar URL?
      answer: Open on your laptop https://www.facebook.com/events/calendar. Right-click on "Add to Calendar" and select "Copy link address" to get your Facebook Calendar URL.
    - 
      question: Which calendars are supported?
      answer: We support calendars that use the iCal format. This includes most popular calendar services like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Facebook Events, Teamup, and others. If your calendar supports iCal, you can sync it with WeDance.
    - 
      question: How often are the calendars synchronized?
      answer: Calendars are synchronized daily at 16:00 Berlin time.
    - 
      question: Will all my events be imported?
      answer: Only upcoming events that align with specific criteria will be imported to WeDance. To ensure relevance to our dance-focused community, imported events must include a public Facebook event link in their description and contain keywords that match various dance styles. This selective approach ensures that our platform remains dedicated to dance-related events, offering our users access to the most relevant and engaging dance activities available.
    - 
      question: Can I modify imported events?
      answer: Yes, you can modify the details of the imported events on WeDance. However, changes made to events on WeDance won't be reflected back in your original calendar. It's important to ensure that the most accurate and up-to-date information is maintained in both places.
    - 
      question: Will changes made to my Facebook event be updated on WeDance?
      answer: Events from Facebook are imported to WeDance only once. This means that any subsequent changes made to the event on Facebook, such as date changes, cancellations, or other updates, will not be automatically reflected on WeDance. To ensure accuracy, it's important for users to manually update the event information on WeDance if there are any changes after the initial import. We encourage event organizers to regularly check and update their event details to provide the most current information to the WeDance community.
    - 
      question: What should I do if an event is canceled or details change after importing?
      answer: You will need to manually update this information on WeDance. We recommend regularly checking your events to ensure all information is current and accurate.
    - 
      question: How can I disconnect my calendar if I no longer want to sync events?
      answer: You can disconnect your calendar at any time from the Integrations section in your Settings. Once disconnected, no further events will be imported from that calendar.
    - 
      question: Is my personal information secure when I connect my calendar?
      answer: Yes, your privacy and security are paramount to us. We only use calendar access to import events and do not store any personal information from your calendar.
