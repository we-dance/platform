## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to WeDance!

We expect contributors to abide by our underlying [code of conduct](https://wedance.vip/coc). All conversations and discussions on GitHub (issues, pull requests) and across [wedance.vip](https://wedance.vip/) must be respectful and harassment-free.

Remember that communication is the lifeblood of any Open Source project. We are all working on this together, and we are all benefiting from this software. It's very easy to misunderstand one another over asynchronous, text-based conversations: When in doubt, assume everyone within this project has the best intentions.

We are all humans trying to work together to improve the community. Always be kind and appreciate the need for trade-offs. ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue.

[See issues](https://github.com/we-dance/platform/issues) or [Create an issue](https://github.com/we-dance/platform/issues/new/choose).

### Where to contribute

Documentation is almost always a great place to start contributing to a new project. WeDance is an Open Source, community-driven project. Therefore, providing and maintaining quality documentation is one of our most important jobs. You can find more information in our docs guide!

Refactoring, which involves improving the code without modifying behavior, is a great place to help out! Generally speaking, you can rely on existing tests to ensure that your refactor doesn't introduce any unexpected behavior. If an area isn't well tested, you might be asked to include a regression test with your refactoring PR. Refactors can touch many files, so we encourage breaking big changes into small PRs.

Fixing bugs is a super fast way to improve the experience for our users! When you're fixing bugs, we appreciate communication in a GitHub issue. If an issue exists, please claim that issue and link it in your PR, otherwise creating an issue is the best first step! Be sure to surround bug fixes with ample tests; bugs are magnets for other bugs. Write tests around bugs!

Building features requires a lot of communication, but we'd love to have your help with this too! Features tend to be subjective and might spur some debate. Be sure to create an issue for new features before getting started! If your feature involves design changes, including design mockups can be very helpful. As always, when in doubt, ask!

### How to contribute

We'd love to see your pull requests, even if it's just to fix a typo!

However, any significant improvement should be associated to an existing feature request or bug report.

#### Getting started

- Setup project locally (see Setup).
- Make changes to code.
- Checkout new branch and commit your changes.
- Deploy to Netlify.
- Create a Pull Request and include a link to your Netlify demo.

#### Code Style

##### js, html, vue

As you might have noticed already, we are using ESLint to enforce a code standard. Please run `yarn lint` before committing your changes to verify that the code style is correct. If not, you can use `yarn lint --fix` to fix most of the style changes. If there are still errors left, you must correct them manually.

##### git

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). See examples of [good commits](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and [bad commits](http://whatthecommit.com/).
