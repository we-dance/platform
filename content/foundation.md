## Projects

**[Awesome Dance](https://github.com/we-dance/awesome-dance)** - a curated list of awesome dance apps and services

**[InstaFest](https://razbakov.com/projects/instantfest/)** - website builder for dance organisers (festivals, studios, indie teachers), which is using Platform widgets to transform any static website to a social network (so to say).

**WeDance Hackathon** - organised gathering of programmers and makers to brainstorm and try out ideas for dance industry.

**WeDance Here** - partnership program for venues (dance places, studios, bars). Venues show that it's a place to dance and help dancers to find other dancers by having a sticker on the door. WeDance highlight places in the city listing and promote non-competitive events.
