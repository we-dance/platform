history:
  'Afro-Cuban ritual dances form a huge group of Cuban dances and reflect the four main groups of Africans that were transported to Cuba: the Kongo-Angola of west-central Africa, Arará (as they are known in Cuba, descendants of Fon and other ethnic groups from what are now Benin and Togo), Yoruba (largely from Nigeria), and Carabalí (as they are known in Cuba, from the Calabar River regions of Cameroon and Nigeria). The best-known dances are attached to the Yoruba-based Afro-Cuban religion of Santería, or La Religión Lucumí. Santería is a syncretic interlacing of intra-African and Roman Catholic–African belief systems and religious practices. Both men and women sing and dance, but only men traditionally play the sacred batá drums that accompany the rituals. The percussive rhythms, songs, and dances of Santería are meant to please the orishas (deities) and to persuade them to join the celebration; their acceptance is signaled by their manifestation within the dancers’ bodies, what participants often describe as possession. Possession is signaled when a dancer abruptly breaks from the basic repetitious dance step, pitches forward or shakes, and then begins the distinct movements that characterize the orisha. For instance, Yemanya (whose name has several variant spellings) is the orisha of the ocean; when a female dancer experiences possession, she may lift her skirts and move them in a way that suggests the swells of an ocean wave. Transformation through dancing in pursuit of spiritual communication is also found in Haitian Vodou and Brazilian Candomblé (discussed further in the Haiti and Brazil sections below).


  Cuba’s many other dance celebrations include a summer festival in the city of Santiago de Cuba at the end of each July. This event began as the feast of the city’s patron saint (Santiago, or St. James) on July 25. (In 1953 Fidel Castro chose the celebration of the extended festival to camouflage his assault on a military garrison in Santiago, an event commemorated in the name of the 26th of July Movement.) The festival also coincided with the traditional end of the sugarcane harvest. At this event it is possible to view traditional Carnival dances, such as conga and chancletas (“sandals”), which originated in the colonial period. Conga is an upbeat walking dance that accents the fourth beat of the measure as the dancers (solo or in groups) wind through the streets. In formal parade units, simple conga choreographies give form and shape to the dance, but the essence of the dance is most evident in the spontaneous crowd dancing along with the musicians through the streets. Chancletas uses a specific form of wooden shoe that accentuates or embellishes the music with rhythmic footwork under loose and swiveling hips. As with conga, it is the relaxed and spontaneous meandering that defines this dance.


  Also, the African religious cofradías (confraternities), known as cabildos in Cuba, were allowed to parade on January 6, Día de los Tres Reyes (Three Kings’ Day), and during Carnival. In socialist Cuba many of the rituals of the Roman Catholic Church were eliminated or secularized; Carnival was separated from Lent and moved to July in Havana, for example. Yet the explosive joy that results from taking a break from work and dancing in the streets at night has remained central to the celebrations.
