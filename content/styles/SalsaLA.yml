  lifts.
history: Rogelio Moreno, Francisco and Luis Vazquez are credited for the early
  development and growth of LA Style as well as Albert Torres, Laura Canellias
  and Joe Cassiniare. Later dancers such as Alex Da Silva, Edie Lewis, Joby
  Martinez and Johnny Vazquez are often credited with developing the LA style of
  dancing as we know it today.
