name: Salsa Colombian
synonyms: Cali style, Salsa Cale√±a
description: The central feature is the footwork which has quick rapid steps and
  skipping motions. Colombian style does not execute Cross-body Leads or the
  "Dile Que No" as seen in other styles, but rather step in place and displace
  in closed position. Their footwork is intricate and precise, helping several
  Colombian Style dancers win major world championships. Cali hosts many annual
  salsa events such as the World Salsa Cali Festival and the Encuentro de
  Melomanos y Coleccionistas.
history: The elements of Cali-Style Salsa were strongly influenced by dances to
  Caribbean rhythms which preceded salsa, such as Pachanga and Boogaloo.
