name: Cubaton
synonyms: perreo
description: Sexy, wild and powerful but also smooth and erotic, just like
  perreo, the dance that goes with it. Europeans have been shaking their butts

  the center of attention during this dance. The vigorous shaking of the female
  Culo, as the deified backside is called in Latin America, is compulsory for
  perreo.
